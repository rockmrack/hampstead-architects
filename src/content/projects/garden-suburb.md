  conservation: true
challenge: "This 1910 Arts & Crafts house in Hampstead Garden Suburb had been altered insensitively in the 1980s. Replacement windows were incorrect, the original oak staircase had been painted white, and a poorly-designed rear extension blocked natural light. The Garden Suburb Trust required restoration to original Arts & Crafts principles while allowing modern family living."
solution: "We engaged an architect specializing in Arts & Crafts restoration. The 1980s extension was demolished and replaced with a sensitive oak-framed garden room using traditional mortise-and-tenon joinery. Original leaded windows were restored by specialist glaziers. The oak staircase was stripped back to natural timber using gentle chemical methods. New handmade clay roof tiles were sourced from the original supplier. The result respects Lutyens' original design ethos while providing contemporary comfort."

## The Challenge

Hampstead Garden Suburb is one of London's most protected conservation areas, with strict design guidelines enforcing Arts & Crafts architectural integrity. This house had been compromised by decades of inappropriate alterations.

## Our Approach

### Phase 1: Historical Research

We consulted the Garden Suburb Archive to understand the house's original 1910 design. Paint analysis revealed the original exterior colour scheme. This research informed our restoration strategy and formed the basis of our planning application.

### Phase 2: Restoring Authenticity

The entire property was returned to Arts & Crafts principles:
- Replaced all 1980s uPVC windows with handmade steel casements and traditional leaded lights
- Stripped painted oak staircase back to natural timber
- Restored original decorative plasterwork and picture rails
- Replaced modern doors with period-appropriate oak ledged doors

### Phase 3: Sensitive Extension

The new garden room was designed to complement the Arts & Crafts aesthetic:
- Oak post-and-beam construction with exposed joints
- Handmade clay tiles to match the main roof
- Bronze casement windows in proportion with the original house
- Lime mortar for all brickwork and pointing
- Internal oak panelling with hand-forged ironmongery

### Phase 4: Landscape Integration

The garden was redesigned following Gertrude Jekyll principles:
- Herbaceous borders with period-appropriate planting
- Restored original York stone terrace
- Traditional brick pathways with tumbled edges
- Oak pergola with climbing roses

## The Result

The house now embodies the Arts & Crafts Movement's principles of truth to materials and honest construction. The Garden Suburb Trust commended the restoration as "exemplary." The property's value increased by 22%.
