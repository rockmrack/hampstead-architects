challenge: "The Victorian terrace had a dark, cramped kitchen extension from the 1970s. The clients wanted a light-filled family space, but the property is in the Belsize Conservation Area with strict design guidelines."
solution: "We designed a single-storey extension using handmade bricks that complement (rather than match) the Victorian stock brick. Large crittal-style steel windows flood the space with light while referencing industrial Victorian glazing. A flat roof with hidden parapet creates a clean, modern profile that respects the roofline of the original house."

## The Brief

A young family needed a kitchen-dining space that connected to their garden. The existing 1970s extension was poorly built and thermally inefficient.

## Design Response

We created a contemporary garden room that feels distinct from the Victorian house while respecting its proportions and materials.

### Material Palette

- **Brickwork**: Northcot handmade bricks in a Flemish bond
- **Windows**: Powder-coated steel in anthracite grey
- **Roof**: EPDM rubber with aluminium coping
- **Floor**: Polished concrete with underfloor heating

## Conservation Area Approval

Camden's Conservation Officer initially expressed concern about the contemporary design. We demonstrated through precedent images and material samples that the extension would enhance rather than harm the Conservation Area character.

Key to approval was the commitment to high-quality materials and detailing rather than pastiche Victorian styling.
