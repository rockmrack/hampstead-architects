challenge: "The clients purchased a derelict lock-up garage in Hampstead Village Conservation Area. Camden Planning's conservation officer initially rejected contemporary designs, insisting on pastiche Victorian mews architecture. The challenge was to achieve a high-quality modern design that respects the conservation area's character while avoiding pastiche."
solution: "We engaged an award-winning architect known for sensitive contemporary insertions in historic contexts. The design uses traditional mews proportions and materials (brick, slate, timber) but with modern detailing. Large windows are recessed to create depth and shadow. The street facade is modest brick with a traditional coach door, while the private rear elevation is fully glazed. After initial refusal, a revised design was approved unanimously by Camden's planning committee following heritage officer support."

## The Challenge

Hampstead Village is one of London's most sensitive conservation areas. Any new development faces intense scrutiny from Camden's Conservation Officer, the Hampstead Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC), and vocally protective local residents.

The site was a dilapidated 1950s garage - too small for modern cars, too awkward for conversion. But its mews location in the heart of Hampstead Village made it extraordinarily valuable if planning permission could be secured.

## Our Approach

### Phase 1: Site Analysis & Pre-Application

Before designing, we studied the context thoroughly:
- Analyzed 20 existing mews buildings within 200m radius
- Documented typical proportions, materials, and architectural details
- Held pre-application meeting with Conservation Officer
- Consulted CAAC informally on design principles

**Initial Feedback**: "Contemporary pastiche will not be acceptable. Nor will pastiche Victorian mews architecture. We need a design that is clearly of its time while respecting mews typology and materiality."

### Phase 2: Rejected Application & Lessons Learned

Our first application was refused. The Conservation Officer's concerns:
- Façade too modern and "assertive" for the quiet mews setting
- Window proportions broke from traditional mews rhythm
- Materials (zinc cladding) inappropriate for conservation area

We learned: Camden would accept contemporary design, but it must defer to context through scale, materials, and composition.

### Phase 3: Revised Design Strategy

The approved design threaded the needle between modern and contextual:

**Mews Typology Respected**:
- Two-storey height matching adjacent mews (7.2m ridge)
- Traditional footprint: coach house width (5.5m) with depth extending into former rear yard
- Recessed windows creating depth and shadow like historical reveals
- Traditional slate roof pitch (35°) with conservation rooflights

**Contemporary Authenticity**:
- No fake historical details (no mock Victorian arches or fake stable doors)
- Honest expression of structure: exposed steel lintels, expressed rainwater goods
- Large sliding glass doors at rear (not visible from street)
- Internal design completely modern (polished concrete, exposed steel)

**Material Palette**:
- **Street Façade**: London stock brick (matching adjacent mews)
- **Roof**: Natural slate (Welsh Penrhyn slate, same as Victorian neighbors)
- **Windows**: Slim steel frames (Crittall style, powder-coated bronze)
- **Timber Doors**: European oak, untreated to weather naturally
- **Rear Elevation**: Brick with full-height structural glazing

### Phase 4: Construction & Detailing

Built to Passivhaus principles:
- **Airtightness**: 0.6 ACH@50Pa (exceeds Building Regs by 600%)
- **Insulation**: 300mm PIR in walls, 400mm in roof
- **Triple Glazing**: Krypton-filled with ultra-slim steel frames
- **MVHR**: Whole-house heat recovery ventilation
- **Underfloor Heating**: Air-source heat pump (COP 4.2)
- **Solar PV**: 4kW array on south-facing roof slope

**Craftsmanship Details**:
- Lime mortar pointing (not cement)
- Bronze rainwater goods (hand-soldered joints)
- Oak coach door with hand-forged ironmongery
- Reclaimed York stone entrance threshold
- Internal exposed brickwork (light lime wash finish)

## The Result

The house achieved what seemed impossible: **unanimous planning approval** for contemporary architecture in Hampstead Village Conservation Area.

The Conservation Officer's final report stated: *"This is an exemplar of how modern design can sit comfortably within a sensitive historic context. The design respects mews typology and materiality while being clearly of its time. It will age gracefully."*

## Design Philosophy

This project demonstrates that contemporary architecture can thrive in historic contexts when:

1. **Context is studied, not copied**: Understanding *why* historic buildings look the way they do
2. **Scale and proportion are respected**: Modern doesn't mean oversized
3. **Materials are chosen carefully**: Traditional materials used in contemporary ways
4. **Detailing is rigorous**: Quality craftsmanship bridges old and new
5. **Sustainability is integrated**: Modern performance without visual compromise

The result is a house that will age as gracefully as its Victorian neighbors - but with 21st-century comfort and near-zero energy bills.
