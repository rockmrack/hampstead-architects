challenge: "The client wanted to add significant living space to their top-floor flat in a 1960s mansion block. The challenge was threefold: structural capacity of the existing roof, achieving planning consent in a visible location, and creating a contemporary addition that complemented the brutalist architecture below."
solution: "We designed a lightweight steel-framed extension clad in zinc standing seam, referencing the materiality of the original building. Floor-to-ceiling frameless glazing maximizes views across Hampstead Heath while minimizing visual bulk. Structural calculations proved the existing concrete frame could support the addition without costly underpinning. Camden Planning approved the contemporary design as it 'respects through contrast' rather than pastiche."

## The Vision

Our client, an art collector, needed gallery-quality space to display their collection while enjoying panoramic views across North London.

## Design Philosophy

Rather than attempting to match the 1960s brutalist aesthetic, we designed a deliberately contemporary glass pavilion that sits lightly on the roof. The zinc cladding echoes the materiality of the original concrete, while the transparency creates a visual 'weightlessness'.

## Technical Innovation

### Structural Strategy

The existing 1960s concrete frame was analyzed by structural engineers. We discovered sufficient capacity existed in the perimeter beams to support a lightweight steel addition without strengthening works—saving £180,000 in costs.

### Glazing System

We specified 3-meter-high structural glazing with minimal sightlines. The glass is triple-glazed with solar coating to prevent artwork fading while maintaining thermal performance (U-value 0.8).

### Environmental Performance

- Photovoltaic panels integrated into the zinc roof
- Natural cross-ventilation via automated roof vents
- Underfloor heating using air-source heat pump
- Rainwater harvesting for roof garden irrigation

## Planning Success

The application was initially recommended for refusal by planning officers. We commissioned accurate visualizations from key viewpoints and demonstrated through shadow studies that overshadowing of neighbors was minimal. The application was approved unanimously at committee.

## The Space Today

The extension functions as both a living gallery and entertaining space. Rotating exhibitions from the client's collection are enjoyed against a backdrop of views to Primrose Hill and the City beyond.
