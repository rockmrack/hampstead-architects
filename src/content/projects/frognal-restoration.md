challenge: "This 1820s Georgian townhouse had suffered from decades of inappropriate repairs. Modern cement render was trapping moisture, rotted sash windows had been replaced with uPVC, and original stonework was deteriorating. English Heritage required a historically accurate restoration while meeting modern energy performance standards."
solution: "We assembled a specialist team experienced in Georgian architecture. Original lime mortar and render were reinstated using traditional hot-mixed techniques. All sash windows were rebuilt to exact Georgian profiles using slow-grown timber. Stone repairs used Bath stone sourced from the original quarry. Secondary glazing was discreetly fitted behind restored sashes for thermal performance. The result satisfied both English Heritage and Camden Planning's Conservation Officer."

## The Challenge

This magnificent Georgian townhouse on Frognal had been compromised by well-intentioned but historically inappropriate repairs over the past 50 years. The cement render was causing serious moisture issues, damaging the original brickwork beneath.

## Our Approach

### Phase 1: Research & Consent

We conducted detailed archival research at Camden Archives to understand the original build specification. Paint analysis revealed the original colour scheme. This evidence formed the basis of our Listed Building Consent application.

### Phase 2: Lime Render Restoration

All cement render was carefully removed. The brickwork beneath was left to breathe for three months before new lime render was applied in traditional coats: scratch coat, floating coat, and finishing coat with tallow for water resistance.

### Phase 3: Sash Window Reconstruction

Each of the 22 sash windows was measured, and new windows were made using slow-grown European redwood with traditional mortise-and-tenon joints. Original crown glass was retained where possible.

### Phase 4: Stonework Repairs

Deteriorated Bath stone lintels and sills were pieced in with matching stone. Lime mortar pointing was raked out and repointed using NHL 3.5 with local sand to match the original.

## The Result

The house now performs thermally better than before while looking exactly as it did in 1825. The client received a Camden Design Award and the property increased in value by 18%.
