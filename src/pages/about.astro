        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            Hampstead Architects & Interiors was born from a problem we encountered repeatedly at <strong>Hampstead Renovations Group</strong>, our construction arm.
          </p>

          <p>
            Clients would arrive with beautiful drawings from talented architects—drawings that were structurally impossible, planning-doomed, or budget-catastrophic. The architect specialized in minimalist new-builds, but the client needed a heritage restoration specialist. Or the design was exquisite but assumed unlimited funds.
          </p>

          <p>
            We found ourselves acting as mediators: "This won't pass Camden Conservation. Your party wall surveyor will reject this. The Listed Building Consent officer will laugh at this proposal."
          </p>

          <p class="text-xl text-charcoal/90 font-light italic border-l-3 border-oxidized-copper pl-6">
            The mismatch between client needs and architect specialization was costing everyone—time, money, and emotional energy.
          </p>

          <p>
            So in 2018, we formalized what we'd been doing informally: <strong>architectural curation</strong>.
          </p>

          <p>
            We leveraged our 15 years of construction relationships to build a network of London's finest specialist studios—each vetted not just for design talent, but for delivery reliability, planning pragmatism, and client empathy.
          </p>

          <p>
            Today, <strong>Hampstead Architects & Interiors</strong> operates from Palace Court on Finchley Road as an independent concierge service, affiliated with but distinct from the construction business. We match, we curate, we oversee—but we never impose a singular style.

              Unlike standalone architectural practices, we have <strong>Hampstead Renovations Group</strong> in our DNA. This means:

                  Every design concept is reviewed by our construction team <em>before</em> you see it. No fantasy drawings that cost double to build.

                <h4 class="font-medium text-oxidized-copper mb-3">Cost Certainty</h4>
                <p class="text-base">
                  We provide accurate cost guidance from Day 1. If your architect proposes handmade Moroccan zellige, we know the real price—not the optimistic estimate.
                </p>

                  If you choose Hampstead Renovations as your contractor, there's zero friction between design and execution. We speak both languages.

                <p class="text-base">
                  We remain your ally throughout. If the architect's vision drifts from your brief, we intervene. If the contractor cuts corners, we hold them accountable.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              Our role is to expand your access to talent, not restrict it. We introduce you to architects you'd never find on Google—specialists who don't advertise because they work exclusively through referrals.

            <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
              15 years in Hampstead, Belsize Park, and Primrose Hill means we know Camden Planning better than most architects. We know which officers favor contemporary insertions in conservation areas, which ones demand brick-for-brick matching, and how to navigate Article 4 Direction constraints.

              Every architect in our network carries £2 million+ professional indemnity insurance, maintains RIBA Chartered status (or equivalent), and has passed our financial stability checks. We eliminate risk before you ever meet them.

      <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        <p>
          Hampstead isn't just our address—it's our laboratory. This is where <strong>heritage conservation meets contemporary aspiration</strong>, where planning restrictions are strictest, where basements cost £10,000 per cubic meter, and where clients expect museum-quality interiors.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you can navigate Hampstead's Grade II listed terraces, Article 4 directions, and conservation area constraints, you can handle any architectural challenge in London.
        </p>

        <p class="text-xl font-light italic">
          We learned the hard way—through 15 years of party wall disputes, planning appeals, and structural engineer standoffs—so you don't have to.
