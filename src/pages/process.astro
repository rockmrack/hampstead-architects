          Why Our Concierge Model Works
        </h2>

        <div class="space-y-6 text-lg leading-relaxed opacity-90">
          <p>
            Traditional architectural practices operate on a one-size-fits-all model. But a Conservation Area specialist isn't necessarily an expert in contemporary basements.
          </p>

          <p>
            We've built relationships with Hampstead's finest architects—each a master in their domain. Your project gets the exact expertise it deserves.
          </p>

          <p>
            And because we're part of the Hampstead Renovations Group, we guarantee continuity from design to build. No disconnects. No surprises.
