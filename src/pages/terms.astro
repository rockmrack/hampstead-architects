            These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of services provided by Hampstead Architects & Interiors ("we", "us", "our", "the Company"), operating from Palace Court, 250 Finchley Road, London NW3 6DN.
          </p>
          <p>

          <p>

          <p>
            The selected architect leads design work under our supervision. We remain responsible for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ensuring design aligns with budget and buildability requirements</li>
            <li>Coordinating planning applications and building control submissions</li>

          <p>
            Architectural fees are set by the selected design studio, typically structured as:
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">4.3 Coordination Fee</h3>
          <p>
            Hampstead Architects & Interiors charges a <strong>Project Coordination Fee</strong> of 3-5% of construction value (minimum £5,000) for:

            <strong>Transparency Commitment:</strong> If Hampstead Renovations Group is appointed as Principal Contractor, our coordination fee is waived and absorbed into the construction contract. You never pay twice.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">4.4 Payment Terms</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Invoices are payable within 14 days of issue</li>
            <li>Late payments incur interest at 4% above Bank of England base rate</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to suspend services for accounts 30+ days overdue</li>

            <li>Notify us immediately of any changes to project scope, budget, or timeline</li>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3">6.1 Architect Selection and Quality Standards</h3>
          <p>
            All architects in our network are vetted for:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>RIBA Chartered status or equivalent professional qualification</li>
            <li>Professional indemnity insurance (minimum £2 million cover)</li>
            <li>Track record in similar project typologies</li>
            <li>Financial stability and credit worthiness</li>
            <li>Client satisfaction ratings and references</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">6.2 Non-Exclusive Relationships</h3>
          <p>
            Our network architects are independent practices. We do not claim exclusivity, and they remain free to accept direct commissions. However, projects initiated through our curation process remain under our coordination throughout delivery.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-xl font-medium mb-3 mt-6">6.3 Direct Engagement Prohibition</h3>
          <p>
            If you bypass our service and engage a network architect directly within <strong>24 months</strong> of being introduced through our platform, you agree to pay our standard coordination fee as liquidated damages (not penalty).
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-charcoal/70 italic">
            Rationale: Our curation, vetting, and matching service has commercial value. Circumventing this undermines our business model.
